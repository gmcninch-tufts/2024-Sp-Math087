1. *Mass estimation*  
   Suppose you are assembling components for a piece of heavy
   machinery. The final product involves 5 components, `a`, `b`, `c`,
   `d`, and `e`. You require estimates for the total mass of each of
   the components.
   
   You have take measurements of the mass of *groups* of the components:
   
   ``` python
   mass_estimates = {('a', 'b', 'c'): 551.03,
                     ('a', 'b', 'd'): 353.19,
                     ('a', 'b', 'e'): 574.36,
                     ('a', 'c', 'd'): 506.1,
                     ('a', 'c', 'e'): 724.92,
                     ('a', 'd', 'e'): 531.9,
                     ('b', 'c', 'd'): 478.21,
                     ('b', 'c', 'e'): 701.98,
                     ('b', 'd', 'e'): 504.75,
                     ('c', 'd', 'e'): 653.07
                     }
   ``` 
   
   For example, the equality
   ```python
   mass_estimates[('a','b','c')] == 551.03
   ``` 
   means
   that the sum of the masses of components `a`, `b`, and `c` is
   `551.03`.
   
   Let's write `ma`,`mb`,`mc`,`md`,`me` for the masses of the
   components.
   
   The estimates amount to linear equations in the variables `ma`, `mb`, ... 
   e.g. we have
   
   ``` python
   ma + mb + mc == 551.03
   ma + mb + md == 353.19
   ma + mb + me == 576.36
   # ... etc ...
   ```
   
   Write 
   ``` python
   b = array([551.03, 353.19, 574.36, 506.1, 724.92, 531.9, 478.21, 701.98, 504.75, 653.07])
   ```
   
   a. Find an estimate for the vector 
      ``` python
      x = array([ ma, mb, mc, md, me ])
      ```
      which is the *least squares solution* to the equation
      ```python
      M @ x = b
      ```
      Put another way, find the
      vector `x` as above such that 
      the length of the vector 
      ``` python
      b - M @ x
      ```
      is minimized.
      
   b. Using your *least-squares solution* from a., estimate the total mass of the
      assembled machine; i.e. estimate the sum
      ``` python
      ma + mb + mc + md + me 
      ```

   c. Explain why you know that the equation 
      ``` python
	  M @ x == b
	  ```
	  has no solution `x`.


2. *Curve fitting*

   An object was catapulted vertically into the air from atop a tall
   building -- it traveled upwards, then fell straight to the
   ground. 
   
   The object was equipped with an altimeter and a recorder, so you
   have some data about its height above ground at various points
   during its flight.
   
   Neglecting air resistance, we know from physics that the height above
   ground of the object is a *quadratic* function
   
   $$f(t) = \alpha t^2 + \beta t + \delta.$$
   
   The following dictionary `height_esimates` indicates the height
   `height_estimates[t]` in meters above ground of the object after
   `t` seconds:
   
   ``` python
   height_estimates = {0.0: 199.6,
                       0.25: 202.96,
                       0.5: 207.23,
                       0.75: 208.29,
                       1.0: 207.47,
                       1.25: 203.96,
                       1.5: 199.18,
                       1.75: 202.91,
                       2.0: 204.29,
                       2.25: 196.31,
                       2.5: 195.71,
                       2.75: 187.89,
                       3.0: 187.61,
                       3.25: 177.12,
                       3.5: 171.07,
                       3.75: 171.89,
                       4.0: 158.68,
                       4.25: 152.64,
                       4.5: 146.7,
                       4.75: 138.52,
                       5.0: 127.27,
                       5.25: 122.38,
                       5.5: 103.97,
                       5.75: 96.91,
                       6.0: 83.08,
                       6.25: 67.34,
                       6.5: 55.75,
                       6.75: 45.42,
                       7.0: 25.33,
                       7.25: 14.67,
                       7.5: -1.45}
   ```
   
   We can see a graph of these values as follows
   
   ``` python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   def plot_data(x,y):
     fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6))
     return ax.plot(x,y,"o")
   
   x1 = height_estimates.keys()
   y1 = list(height_estimates.values())
   plot_data(x1,y1)   
   ```
   
   
   a. Find the values of the coefficients $\alpha,\beta,\delta$
      so that 
	  $$f(t) = \alpha t^2 + \beta t + \delta.$$
	  is the *best fit* for the available data.
	  What is the initial height above ground (i.e. the height of the tall building?)
	  What is the initial velocity of the object?

   b. Produce via `matplotlib` a graph of the function `f` you
      obtained as the best-fit in a., superimposed on the data plot
      above. (You can use the code from the lecture notebook).

   c. Since we know that acceleration due to gravity is
      (approximately) -9.8 m/s near the Earth's surface, we actually
      know that the function $f$ should be given by $$(\clubsuit) \quad f(t)
      = \dfrac{-9.8}{2}t^2 + \beta t + \delta.$$
	  
	  Now find the values of the coefficients $\beta,\delta$ so that
	  $(\clubsuit)$ is the *best fit* for the available data.
	  
	  Are your estimates for the height of the building or the initial
      velocity affected by this simplification?

   b. Produce via `matplotlib` a graph of the function `f` you obtained
      as the best-fit in c., superimposed on the data plot above.
	  (You can use the code from the lecture notebook).
