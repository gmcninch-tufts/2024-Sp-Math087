1. One man’s trash

   You are at a yard sale, and have spied four crates of goods. You’ve
   estimated the value of each crate; these values are listed as
   **actual value** in the following table.
   
   The owner has no idea what these items are worth, and is selling
   them for far less than they are worth; the prices being asked are
   listed as **sales price** in the following table).

   Finally, the *weight* of each of the crates is listed in the table,
   as well.
   
   | crate | actual value | sales price | weight in kg |
   |-------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
   | A     | $ 5000       | $ 24        |         75.5 |
   | B     | $ 600        | $ 76        |          2.7 |
   | C     | $ 3500       | $ 43        |          3.3 |
   | D     | $ 6000       | $ 754       |          6.7 |

   
   
   You realize that you can purchase these crates and sell them at a
   much higher mark up. However, you walked to the yard sale and can
   only buy what you can carry on your person.
   
   You have 800 dollars, and you and your friend together can carry an estimated 85 kg.
   
   
   Fortunately, you have identified this as an integer programming
   problem!
   
   a. Describe an integer linear program which models the situation
      (think carefully about what values the variables can take).
	  
   b. Use the branch and bound algorithm to find the optimal solution,
      explaining your choices for which variables to branch on and
      where to prune the tree.
	  
   c. Draw the branch and bound tree for your solution.
      
   (**Hint**: Note that you should use `linprog` to solve the relaxed
   linear program, initially with your variables constrained between 0
   and 1).


2. Consider the following directed graph (see below for the code producing this graph).
   
   ![](/course-assets/images/PS4--graph.png)

   a. Find the `minimum cut` value for this weighted
      directed graph.
	  
	  (Recall that this means to consider all possible partitions of
	  the nodes into an $s$-group and a $t$-group.
	 
	  To identify such a partition, it is enough to indicate the
	  $s$-group. For example, $s$, $a$ and $c$ together form a
	  possible $s$-group.  The edge-cuts required to form this
	  $s$-group involve the edges $c \to d$ and $a \to b$; thus the
	  cut-value for this partition is $14 + 12 = 26$.
	 
	  Make a list all possible $s$-groups and indicate the
	  corresponding cut-values. Remember that we are only interested
	  in partitions that arise "from cuts" -- thus, an $s$-group
	  should be "connected". And remember that cut value only involve
	  capacities of edges $u \to v$ where $u$ is in the $s$-group and
	  $v$ is in the $t$-group (you would not also count the capacity
	  of an edge $v \to u$ if it exists).

   b. By strong duality, you now know the `maximum flow` value for the
      graph. Does strong duality tell you how to find a flow which
      achieves this value? Why or why not?

   c. Suppose that the capacity on the edge $d \to t$ is increased
      from its current value of 4. By how much must this capacity
      change in order to change the ``min cut`` configuration?
	  
   d. Would increasing the capacity for the edge $b \to t$ from its
      current value of 20 affect the maximum flow value? Why or why
      not?

   d. Explain whether or not the following statement seems reasonable,
      and why: "The ``min cut`` configuration (i.e. the edges involved
      in the ``min cut``) reflects the maximal bottleneck in the
      system."
   

   Here is the code used to produce the graph; you can [download it here.](/course-assets/images/PS4--graph.py)
   
   ``` python
   from graphviz import Digraph

   dg = Digraph()
   #dg = Digraph(engine='neato')
   
   dg.attr(rankdir='LR')
   
   V = [ 's', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 't' ]
   
   weights = { ('s','a'):   16,
               ('s','c'):   13,
               ('c','a'):    4,
               ('a','c'):   10,
               ('a','b'):   12,
               ('c','d'):   14,
               ('d','b'):    7,
               ('b','d'):    6,
               ('b','t'):   20,
               ('d','t'):    4
              } 
   
   c.node('t')
   
   with dg.subgraph() as c:
       c.attr(rank='same')
       for x in ['a','c']:
           c.node(x)
   
   with dg.subgraph() as c:
       c.attr(rank='same')
       for x in ['b','d']:
           c.node(x)
   
   c.node('s')        
           
   for (f,t) in weights.keys():
       wt = f"{weights[(f,t)]}"
       dg.edge(f,t,wt)
   
   dg.filename='PS4--graph'
   dg.format='png'
   dg.render()
   ```
