# Student Engagement {#engagement}

   The student engagement score is intended to keep you involved in
   the course. It involves a weekly written submission, which I
   promise to read. You will earn the full student engagement score
   for the term if you make "good faith" student engagement
   submissions each week in which it is collected.

# Problem-sets {#problem-sets}

  You may work together with classmates while solving the *problem
  sets* -- you are free to share mathematical and computational ideas
  with other students in the course. However, *any work you submit
  must be written by yourself* -- do not directly copy anyone else's
  work!

  Your solutions/submissions will be marked to reflect the following
  criteria:

  - mathematical correctness
  
    Is the solution mathematically valid? 
  
  - explanation and exposition

    Have assumptions and hypotheses been explained? This includes
    mathematical hypotheses, as well as modeling choices and
    assumptions.

  - computer code
  
    You are free to adapt and use computer code distributed in the
    course (via ``jupyter notebooks``, e.g.).
	
	Inclusion of the code used in your solutions is
    encouraged. (Occasionally, it is required, but this will be made
    clear in the assignment instructions).

# midterm reports

  The midterm reports concern problems that are somewhat more
  elaborate than the usual problem-sets. 
  
  In preparing your submission, take care to write clearly and
  carefully. The same rubric considerations for problem-sets will
  apply.

# final reports {#reports}

  Since you *choose* and get approval for a topic, there are some
  additional rubric criteria. The submission should:

  -  give a clear statement of the problem and your modeling goals.
   
  -  provide an explanation for assumptions made, including discussion
     of how they affect the problem.
   
  -  describe the model used or developed.
   
  -  describe model testing, sensitivity analysis, computational
     requirements, and error analysis.
   
  -  discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your model or approach.
   
  -  provide a literature review. This includes citation of a few
     references of existing research on the subject.
