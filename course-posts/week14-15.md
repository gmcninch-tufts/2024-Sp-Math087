# The remaining course assignments

- [2024-05-03] [[Final project]](/course-assignments/FinReport.html)
  [[pdf]](/course-assignments/FinReport.pdf)
  [[guidelines]](final-project-guidelines.html)

  You should *submit* your final report to gradescope and your video
  to the *box folder* for the class -- you should have recently
  received an "invitation" to join that box-folder. Let me know if you
  did not receive an invitation!
  
  Here is what I would like you to submit to this box folder:
  
  - the video component of your project, in some reasonable [video
    format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_file_format), Please
    name the file containing your video using this format
	
	```
	Jane-Smith-project-video.mkv
	```
	
	(where `mkv` should be replaced by the correct suffix for you
	video format, and `Jane-Smith` should of course be replaced by
	your name).
	
  - the *abstract* from your report to the *box folder*. Use this format
	for the filename:
	
	```
	Jane-Smith-project-abstract.pdf
	```
