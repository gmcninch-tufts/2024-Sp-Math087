This week, we are going to talk about solving linear programs where we
insist on *integrality conditions* on the solutions. The term for this
is `integer programming`. Our tools will be: solving linear programs
("the usual way") together with so-called `branch-and-bound`
strategies to avoid *brute force checking*.

Next week's problem sert (PS04) will likely contain a problem about integer programming.
