  Week05 -- midterm report & integer programming

The first of two *midterm reports* is due this Friday. If you want,
you can look back over the [comments on rubrics I made in an earlier
post](resources--expectations-and-rubrics.html).

This week, we are going to talk about solving linear programs where we
insist on *integrality conditions* on the solutions. The term for this
is `integer programming`. Our tools will be: solving linear programs
("the usual way") together with so-called `branch-and-bound`
strategies to avoid *brute force checking*.

- **Integer programming via branch-and-bound**

Next week's problem sert (PS04) will likely contain a problem about integer programming.
