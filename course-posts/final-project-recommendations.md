# Examples of modeling problems

It might be useful to look at sample "modeling problems" for
inspiration. Here are a couple of online resources ("MathWorks
Modeling Challenge" and "COMAP") with problems from past modeling
contests.

In both cases, there are *a lot* more problems than I've linked
here. (I included some precise links e.g. because I found navigating
these sites a bit clunky and I wanted you to see some samples quickly).

- [MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge](https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/sample-problems/)  
  - ['23 - e-bikes](https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/archives/2023-year-at-a-glance/2023-problem-remote-work-fad-or-future/)
  - ['22 - remote work](https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/archives/2022-year-at-a-glance/2022-problem-remote-work-fad-or-future/)
  - ['21 - digital divide](https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/archives/2021-year-at-a-glance/2021-problem-defeating-the-digital-divide-internet-costs-needs-and-optimal-planning/)
  - [more problems here...](https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/past-problems/)
  

- [COMAP problems](https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/previous-contests.php)
  
  You should be able to see the *problems* here, though apparently you
  can't see the submissions & judges comments without a membership.
  
  Here are some randomly chosen examples of problems.

# Report samples 

  (this example should more-or-less match the given specifications, except that it is 10 pages rather than 8)

# Video recommendations

- The *simplest* way to make the required video for the final project
  is to film yourself speaking while writing on a whiteboard or
  chalkboard.

- A better method is to use video-editing software which will allow
  you to narrate your talk while displaying *slides* which you might
  produce in `LaTeX` using the package `beamer`.
  
  Try *googling* (or searching on `youtube`) for something like:
  
  `presentations using latex and beamer`
  
  - Example of video-editing software: [`openshot`](https://www.openshot.org/)

  - discussion of `beamer` at the `overleaf` site: [`beamer`](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer)
  
  - using these tools will make it easier to *visually demonstrate
    some aspect of mathematics involved in your report*
