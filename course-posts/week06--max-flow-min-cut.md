  Week06 -- Max flow and min cut
date: 2024-02-19
---

Remember that there is no class on Monday, but we meet on both
Wednesday and Thursday this week, since Thursday is a Tufts Monday.

Here is this week's homework assignment.

This week we are going to investigate *Graph Models*. These models
include the *network flows* we previously studied. But now we will
mainly be interested in *flows through graphs* and we discuss methods
referred to as *max flow and min cut* that use *duality* to understand
possible solutions.

Here is the `jupyter` notebook with materials for this week:

- **Graph Models**
  [[via colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gmcninch-tufts/2024-Sp-Math087/blob/main/course-content/week06-01--graph-models.ipynb)
  [[download notebook]](/course-content/week06-01--graph-models.ipynb) 
  [[pdf]](/course-content/week06-01--graph-models.pdf)   

(For what it is worth, this material will certainly need more than a
single lecture. But it may not need 2 whole lectures; if that is the
case, I'll cover a bit of the next section on Thursday. If that comes
to pass, I'll post the relevant notebook...)
