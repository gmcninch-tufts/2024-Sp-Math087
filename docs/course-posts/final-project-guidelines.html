    <section>
        <p>For your final project, you will use mathematical modeling to investigate a topic of your choosing. Your project should combine:</p>
<ul>
<li>research into the topic</li>
<li>modeling a problem related to the topic</li>
<li>carrying out some computation using your model.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must submit the following <em>deliverables</em>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a <em>proposal</em> by [2024-03-29 Friday]</li>
<li>written report by [2024-05-03 Friday]</li>
<li>video presentation to accompany the report, also by [2024-05-03 Friday]</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<h1 id="proposal">Proposal</h1>
<p><em>due [2024-03-29 Friday]</em></p>
<p>Your proposal should be submitted as a <em>PDF</em> on <em>gradescope</em>.</p>
<p>The aim of the proposal is to articulate a clearly defined goal for
your analysis, and to briefly discuss how it you will carry out the
investigation.</p>
<p>You should keep the proposal to a single page (and please use standard
paper- and font- sizes), with a second page for references if necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Full <em>statement of the problem to be investigated</em>. This includes any
constraints you may have to consider.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear <em>statement of the goal of your investigation</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Concise description of what <em>computation(s)</em> you will need to do
for the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Brief assessment of the <em>interest of the problem</em> (to you, or to
others).</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a brief <em>literature review</em> by citing a few references for
the ideas and/or data of your investigation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See below for a discussion of <em>formatting requirements</em> for the report.</p>
<h1 id="report">Report</h1>
<p><em>due [2024-05-03 Friday]</em></p>
<p>Your report should be submitted as a <em>PDF</em> on <em>gradescope</em>. It should
be 6-8 pages (not including references or code).</p>
<p>Your research is <em>not expected to be original or novel</em>. However, it
is expected that you will do a review of the literature on the
problem, discussing what has been done by others (clearly citing that
work) and presenting some analysis of your study.</p>
<p>Submission of your paper warrants that it is written in your own
words, and that you have not copied from any source without direct
citation.</p>
<p>Your report should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief abstract summarizing the results of your project.</li>
<li>Clear statement of the <em>problem</em> and your <em>modeling goals</em>,
including what aspect you have studied.</li>
<li>Explanation of <em>assumptions</em> and a <em>rationale or justification</em> for
how they bear on the problem.</li>
<li>Description of your model and justification for the choice modeling
choices.</li>
<li>Description of model testing, sensitivity analysis, or computation
used, including error analysis.</li>
<li>Discussion of strengths and weaknesses of your model or approach.</li>
<li>Give a Literature Review by citing a few references of current or
past research on the subject.</li>
<li>Discussion of applications to which this problem would be
applicable, or why the analysis you chose provides insight into the
specific research area.</li>
</ul>
<p>See below for a discussion of <em>formatting requirements</em> for the report.</p>
<h1 id="video-presentation">Video Presentation</h1>
<p><em>due [2024-05-03 Friday]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your video presentation will be uploaded to a folder
<em>tufts.box.com</em>, but I haven’t yet set up the necessary folder. I’ll
update these guidelines when this is configured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will make a video recording of a 10 minute presentation
summarizing the analysis you have done in your report. While the
presentation does not have to be as detailed or as technical as your
paper, it should give your audience a clear idea of what you have done
and what you have found.</p>
<p>Your presentation should visually demonstrate some aspect of
mathematics involved in your report; for example, you could carry out
some calculation from your report on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>I’m including some <em>suggestions</em> in the <a href="final-project-recommendations.html"><em>final project
recommendations</em></a>.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-for-the-report">Requirements for the Report</h1>
<p>The following formatting guidelines are loosely based on the
guidelines given for <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/">The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM)
competition</a>, and
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Page Length: Proposal - 2 pages; Final Project Paper - 6-8 pages
(not including references or code).</p></li>
<li><p>You should use standard US paper- and font-sizes (8.5 x 11” paper;
10-12 point fonts) single-spaced and one inch margins (top, bottom,
left, and right). No information should appear in the margins. This
does not apply to attached code.</p></li>
<li><p>Title: You should choose a brief, appropriate title which summarizes
the content of your report.</p></li>
<li><p>your report should include the following</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an <em>abstract</em></p></li>
<li><p>the <em>body</em> of the report</p></li>
<li><p>possibly an <em>appendix</em> if needed (e.g. for <em>code</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See the following discussion for details.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Abstract</em>: The report should begin with an <em>abstract</em> not exceeding
250 words that summarizes the principal techniques and conclusions
of the projects.</p>
<p>Your abstract should clearly describe your approach to
the problem and, most prominently, your most important conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>Code: Brief <code>computer code</code> may be included <em>inline</em> in the report,
but any substantial amount of code should be included in an
<em>appendix</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Illustrations and figures: you should aim for professional quality
in any illustrations you use, though handwritten elements can be
accepted.</p>
<p>Illustrations and figures should be numbered and cited in the text,
and labeled with a descriptive caption.</p>
<p>Please make sure each figure is legible with sufficiently large
font, and that each is clearly labeled with a descriptive caption.</p>
<p>You may include illustrations in the appendix.</p></li>
<li><p>References: You may use any inanimate source of data or material as
a reference. This includes computers, software, journals, web sites,
books, etc.</p>
<p><strong>All sources used must be credited.</strong></p>
<p>Failure to credit a source will result in a significant
penalty. References should be listed in either alphabetical order or
order of citation at the end of the report. The following reference
styles should be used:</p>
<p>While Wikipedia can be used for basic information - especially, for
definitions - you should not use it as a main source, nor should you
copy any substantial phrasing from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Journal articles</p>
<p>[1] R. T. Rockafellar, Lagrange multipliers and optimality, SIAM
Rev., 35 (1993), pp. 183-238</p></li>
<li><p>Books, pamphlets, research reports:</p>
<p>[2] B. Mandelbrot, Fractal: Form, Chance and Dimension,
W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA, 1977.</p></li>
