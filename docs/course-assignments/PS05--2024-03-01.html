            <ol type="1">
<li><p>A mining company needs to set up supply line between a set of
quarries <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and a set of processing plants <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. The company is
interested in setting up perfect matchings of quarries to plants,
i.e. each quarry should have a supply line to a unique processing
plant, such that no quarry or plant is on two supply
lines. Conveniently, there are as many quarries as there are
processing plants. Less conveniently, supply lines need to travel
along roads. Let <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be the set of roads. We assume that each road in
<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> starts at a quarry and travels directly to a processing plant,
and that the roads do not intersect.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Suppose that |U| = |W| = 4 and that there are seven roads
total. Construct an example where no perfect matching is
possible.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion</strong>: for this problem and the rest, we suggest you model this set up as a bipartite graph.</p></li>
<li><p>If no perfect matching exists, the company would like to know
what is the maximal number of quarry/plant pairs such that no
quarry or plant is on two supply chains (call this a maximal
matching). Compute this for your example in a). How many
additional roads must be made in order for a perfect matching to
exist?</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(|U| = |W| = n\)</span>, what is the largest possible size of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>?
Give your answer as an expression in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that for each <span class="math inline">\(x ∈ U\)</span>, there is exactly one road
involving <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and write this edge as <span class="math inline">\(x → w(x)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(w(x) ∈ W\)</span>. Explain why the size of a maximum matching is equal to the
number of distinct nodes <span class="math inline">\(\{w(x)\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Suppose that |U | = |W | = n and let m = |E|. Can you
always find a configuration of roads such that a perfect
matching is impossible? Put differently, is there a minimal m
such that a perfect matching will exist no matter how the roads
are placed?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A streaming service wants to model the annual growth rate of its
subscribers. The data shows that they can roughly predict the
behavior of customers based on how long they have been users of the
service: Let <span class="math inline">\(p_n\)</span> be the current number of subscribers who have had
the service for less than a year, and <span class="math inline">\(p_o\)</span> be the current number of
subscribers who have had the service for more than a year (so in
total there are <span class="math inline">\(p_n + p_o\)</span> subscribers). For convenience we will
refer to the two types of subscriber as “new” and
“old”.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}= \begin{bmatrix} p_n \\ p_o \end{bmatrix}\)</span> be a vector
recording the current subscriber population, and write <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}^*\)</span> be the
subscriber population in one year’s time. Then the data shows that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}∗ = A\mathbf{p}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the matrix given by
<span class="math display">\[A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0.8 &amp; 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>This is, writing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}^* = \begin{bmatrix} q_n \\ q_o \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, there will be <span class="math inline">\(q_n\)</span> “new” users in one years time,
and <span class="math inline">\(q_o\)</span> “old” users.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>What percentage of current new users will still be subscribed by
the start of the next year?</p>
<p>How does this retention rate differ for old users?</p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that A has eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(λ = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0.5\)</span>. Find an
eigenvector for the eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(λ = 1\)</span> and use it to describe the
long term behavior of the user population for this streaming
service. In the long run, what will the ratio of new to old
users be?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that a different streaming service has the rate matrix
<span class="math display">\[B = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 &amp; 0 \\
0.8 &amp; 0.4 \end{bmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>The matrix <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(λ = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0.4\)</span> as its
eigenvalues. Using the eigenvector for the larger of the two
eigenvalues, describe the long term behavior of this streaming
service?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that both streaming services (which we will refer to by
their rate matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), start with the same population
vector p this year, and that both charge $n for a yearly
subscription. Write an expression (in terms of n, pa , pb ) for
the total income obtained by A and B after 4 years.</p></li>
