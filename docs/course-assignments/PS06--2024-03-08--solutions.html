            <h1>PS 06 -- Markov Processes</h1>
            <ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose you’re standing on a street with buildings labelled by the
integers (specifically, you’re in front of the building labelled
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, and suppose that the indices are increasing to the
right). Suppose that every minute you flip a coin. If the coin is
heads you walk right and if the coin is tails you walk left.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Explain why your position (i.e. the building you’re in front of)
as a function of time can be modeled as a Markov process.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Your position at time t is (randomly chosen to be) one step to
the left or to the right of your previous position, and hence is
only dependent on your position at time t − 1. It doesn’t matter
(for instance) what sequence of steps took you to get to your
position at time t − 1, and hence this is a Markov chain.</p>
<p>Somewhat more precisely, the nodes of the <em>transition diagram</em>
are in one-to-one correspondence with the integers <span class="math inline">\(\{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \cdots\}\)</span>, and each node <code>[n]</code> has two outgoing
edges. There is an edge <code>[n] --&gt; [n+1]</code> labeled with probability
1/2, and an edge <code>[n-1] &lt;-- [n]</code> also labeled with probability
1/2. Thus, the probabilities on the outgoing edges always sum to 1.</p>
<p>And the state of the system evolves each minute by applying the
rules of this <em>state machine</em>; this is the definition of a
<em>Markov process</em> (or <em>Markov chain</em>).</p>
</div></li>
<li><p>Can the distance from where you started as a function of time be
modeled by a Markov process?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Yes. In this case, consider the <em>transition diagram</em> whose nodes
are <em>non-negative</em> integers. For any node <code>[n]</code> with <code>n&gt;0</code>,
there are <em>two</em> outgoing edges: <code>[n] --&gt; [n+1]</code> and <code>[n-1] &lt;-- [n]</code>, both of which are labeled with probability 1/2.</p>
<p>If you are standing in front of building
<code>m</code>, the effect of a <code>heads</code> toss and of a <code>tails</code> toss depend
on the <em>sign</em> of <code>m</code>. Namely, if <code>m&gt;0</code> and you toss <code>heads</code>, you
move one building to the right and hence increase your distance
to the origin by one unit, and if you toss <code>tails</code>, you move one
building to the left and hence decrease your distance to the
origin by one unit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if <code>m&lt;0</code> and you toss <code>heads</code>, your
one-building to the right move <em>increases</em> your distance to the
origin by one unit, and if you toss <code>tails</code>, your distance to
the origin <em>decreases</em> by one unit.</p>
<p>Finally, if your distance is <code>0</code>, there is only one outgoing
edge <code>[0] --&gt; [1]</code> and it is assigned a probability of 1, since
either a <code>heads</code> or <code>tails</code> results in a distance of 1 unit from
the origin.</p>
<p>In summary, <code>distance to the origin</code> is governed by the
transition diagram we just described, hence is a Markov process.</p>
</div></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that every minute you flip two coins. If both are
heads, you move right, if both are tails you move left and
otherwise you stay put. Is your distance from where you started
modeled by a Markov process in this scenario? How do you expect
this to compare to the process described in part b?</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
<li><p>For both experiments, compute the probability that you are
standing on an odd number for minute <span class="math inline">\(0,1,2,3,4\)</span>.</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
<li><p>(Optional food for thought) Suppose your friend is playing the
same game, but started at position −100. Do you think it is more
likely that you two will eventually meet or that you two will
never meet? Does this answer change when your friend starts at
−1? How about −10000000?</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Rain or shine On Planet X, the weather is strangely predictable:
The weather is always either sunny, rainy, foggy or snowy. If it
rains today, its sunny tomorrow. If it is sunny today, its rainy
tomorrow. If its foggy today, its not sunny tomorrow. Finally, the
weather is never the same two days in a row. Apart from these
rules, the weather is completely random, in that if e.g. its foggy
today it is equally likely to be either rainy or snowy
tomorrow. You live on Planet X and are trying to figure out what to
wear this week, so you’d like to develop a model for the weather.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Explain why the weather can be modeled as a Markov process. Write
out the transition matrix, and draw the corresponding finite
state machine.</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
<li><p>Check whether the conditions for the Perron-Frobenius theorem is
satisfied for this problem (aperiodic and strongly
connected). Explain your reasoning.</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
<li><p>Do you expect power iteration to be effective for computing the
greatest eigenvector of your transition matrix?</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
<li><p>Find the eigenvalue decomposition for the transition matrix, and
the associated eigenvectors. Explain why these values confirm
your answer to part 2.</p>
<div class="solution">

</div></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the “weather rules” change so that if its sunny
today, it is equally likely to be snowy or rainy tomorrow. Write
out the new transition matrix, associated finite state machine,
and determine whether the conditions for the Perron-Frobenius
are satisfied. Compute the eigenvalue decomposition and compare
to the previous set of eigenvalues.</p>
